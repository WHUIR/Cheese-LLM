## What's Cheese?
Cheese is an open-source LLM trained for the Chinese language by Data Intelligence (Dance) Laboratory, School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Wuhan University. 
On the basis of Chinese-Llama, it is built by further going through a series of pre-training, supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback(RLHF) over different large-scale Chinese datasets that that are web-crawled and high-quality.
Some highlights include a more comprehensive Chinese vocabulary and more than 700K dialogs generated by ChatGPT used through SFT to enhance the capacity of answering diverse information needs. 
The Cheese-LLM is now available on GitHub for use in a wide spectrum of research tasks: question-answering, information search, personal assitant, to name a few.


## Why it's called Cheese?
We chose the name 'Cheese'(芝士) because its Chinese words sounds similarly to 'Knowledge'(知识) and is spelled similar to 'Chinese' in English. This reflects our commitment to developing LLMs that are more knowledgeable in Chinese language, as well as our emphasis on providing a helpful and informative AI assistant.
